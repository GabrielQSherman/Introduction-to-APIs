This is my repo for my REST Api while I follow along

the tutorial I'm following along with a tutorial by Programing with Mosh

you can find the video here; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pKd0Rpw7O48;

As always the first steps are to use the command 'npm init' in the command line, then install neccesary dependencies

Packages used in this tutorial:

express
mongoose
dotenv
