1.npm initalized and neccecary packages installed with 'npm i' or npm install

2. code a index.js file that will be the main hub for the route handling of this project. 

3. connect to the local host with express

4. connect to mongodb with mongoose

5. set enviorment variables and passwords with dotenv, make .env file 

6. use express to handle GET methods for some basic Routes.

7. Create routes folder that contains route handling for specific routes. like the homepage(root-route) or the admin of the database/server that works on a diffrent route to add documents to the database

8. Create a models folder that contains mongoose schemas, this is how data will be formated when going into and out of the database. input will come in as json or formdata and then the document will be json inside of the database. 

Only one schema will be needed for this project because it is just the students graduation post, then comments and messages can be added later

9. set up password to admin route using req.params
